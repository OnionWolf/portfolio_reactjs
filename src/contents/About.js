                <h3>Designer of Information | UX | Communications</h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>A lifelong interest in technology led me to the Information Design program at Mount Royal University, 
                    where I discovered the User Experience field and a passion for human-centered design, information architecture,
                     wireframing, and prototyping. Prior to entering this program I worked as a chef for fifteen years,
                      in positions ranging from dishwasher to sous chef, and the director of a confectionary laboratory.
                       In my free time I love cooking, fiddling with retro electronics, creating art (primarily digital and 3D),
                        playing video games, and chasing my dog Winry around the park.</p>
